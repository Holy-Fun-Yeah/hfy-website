        "content": "# How Planetary Retrogrades Actually Help You Grow\n\nRetrograde seasons get a bad rap, but they offer profound opportunities for reflection and realignment. Learn to work with these cosmic pauses.\n\n## Understanding Retrogrades\n\nWhen a planet appears to move backward in the sky, we call it a retrograde.
